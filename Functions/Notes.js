/*
This section has no test questions so I've taken notes on what I've learned:

The inputs expected to be given to a function are called parameters, inputs given when calling a function are called arguments.

Scope refers to where a variable can be accessed. Global variables are variables that have been declaired outside
of any functions and can be used anywhere within the file. Local variables are declaired within a function. These
variables will cause errors if one attempts to use them outside of the function they are a part of. 

Variable Hoisting is when a variable is assigned a value before it is declaired. This does not cause errors to occur
because of the way Javascript compiles its code. When compiling Javascript takes all variable assignments and moves
them to the top of their relevant scope. While it is possble to utilize variables in this way it is not recommended
as it can cause many different invisible errors.
